              "'Summary: The paper presents low-rank bilinear pooling that uses Hadamard product (commonly known as element-wise multiplication). The paper implements low-rank bilinear pooling on an existing model (Kim et al., 2016b) and builds a model for Visual Question Answering (VQA) that outperforms the current state-of-art by 0.42%. The paper presents various ablation studies of the new VQA model they built.----------------Strengths:----------------1. The paper presents new insights into element-wise multiplication operation which has been previously used in VQA literature (such as Antol et al., ICCV 2015) without insights on why it should work. ----------------2. The paper presents a new model for the task of VQA that beats the current state-of-art by 0.42%. However, I have concerns about the statistical significance of the performance (see weaknesses below).----------------3. The various design choices made in model development have been experimentally verified. ----------------Weaknesses/Suggestions:----------------1. When authors explicitly (keeping rest of the model architecture same) compared low-rank bilinear pooling with compact bilinear pooling, they found that low-rank bilinear pooling performs worse. Hence, it could not be experimentally verified that low-rank bilinear pooling is better in performance than compact bilinear pooling (at least for the task of VQA).----------------2. The authors argue that low-rank bilinear pooling uses 25% less parameters than compact bilinear pooling. So, could the authors please explain how does the reduction in number of parameters help experimentally? Does the training time of the model reduce significantly? Can we train the model with less data? ----------------3. One of the contributions of the paper is that the proposed model outperforms the current state-of-art on VQA by 0.42%. However, I am skeptical that the performance of the proposed model is statistically significantly better than the current state-of-art.----------------4. I would like the authors to explicitly mention the differences between MRN, MARN and MLB. It is not very clear from reading the paper.----------------5. In the caption for Table 1, fix the following: ‚Äúhave not‚Äù -> ‚Äúhave no‚Äù ----------------Review Summary: I like the insights about low-rank bilinear pooling using Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication) presented in the paper. However, it could not be justified that low-rank bilinear pooling leads to better performance than compact biliear pooling. It does lead to reduction in number of parameters but it is not clear how much that helps experimentally. So, to be more convinced I would like the authors to provide experimental justification of why low-rank bilinear pooling is better than other forms of pooling.'"
